When writing unit tests, using a test coverage tool is very important. A test coverage tool will monitor the execution of your test suite and tell you how many of the statements, branches, functions and lines were run as part of your tests. This highlights the parts of your software you may not have tested.

## EclEmma

For this assignment the coverage tool I used was EclEmma. EclEmma is a java code coverage tool for Eclipse, available from the Eclipse marketplace.

EclEmma is simple to set up and does not require any modifications to your project. Once downloaded the tool runs from eclipse. From the menu inside the IDE click Run and from the drop down menu and choose Coverage. The tool will then analyse your code and return information on what has been tested and what has not been tested. The results are immediately summarized and highlighted in your source code editors. See example below.

 EclEmma brings the code coverage analysis directly into your Eclipse workbench. It is straight forward to use and is accurate and effective.
