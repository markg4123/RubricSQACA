In this assignment, I am working individually and accept my own pull requests. After a pull request is created, I will approve it, if there is no more work to be done on it by commenting my approval on the request. The branches can then be merged.

## Code Review Checklist for Pull Requests
---

- Check for bad practices in the code.
- Analyse the impact of the changes being made.
- Ensure there is a high level of readability.
- Make sure there is consistent design and implementation.
- Ensure the quality is high and the code is meeting the requirements.
- Ensure there is correct spelling and grammar as markdown has no spellcheck.

The above is the checklist I used for this assignment when approving pull requests. I found this worked well and minimised errors. Code review is an essential aspect of any software project and should always be carried out correctly.
