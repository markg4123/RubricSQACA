When writing unit tests, using a test coverage tool is very important. A test coverage tool will monitor the execution of your test suite and tell you how many of the statements, branches, functions and lines were run as part of your tests. This points out parts of your software you may not have tested.

For this assignment the coverage tool I used was EclEmma. EclEmma is a java code coverage tool for Eclipse, available from the Eclipse marketplace.

Once downloaded the tool runs from eclipse. From the menu inside the IDE click Run and from the drop down menu choose Coverage. The tool will then analyse your code and return information on what had been tested and what has not been tested. See example below.
