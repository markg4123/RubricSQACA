#  Task Estimation

##  Three-point Estimation

I used three-point estimate as I found that it is the most effective way to estimate tasks in scrum when doing so alone. With three-point estimate, I have three values, 1. The most likely value, 2. The optimistic value and 3. The pessimistic value.To calculate the actual estimate, I add the three values defined above and simply divide by 3. This gives me the most accurate task estimation value.
<br>

<br>
As seen in the Sprint Backlog above, Creating a new Rubric is given a estimation value of 1. Creating a new Rubric is relatively basic and will not require a lot of time to code. Alternatively, calculating the standard deviation is more of a complicated process and will take more time to code. Therefore it is given an estimation value of 4.
<br>

##  Velocity Metric
<br>
The Velocity Metric is calculated by adding up all the estimations for all fully completed tasks at the end of the Sprint. Knowing the velocity of a sprint allows me to know how many sprints it will take to achieve a desired level of functionality.
