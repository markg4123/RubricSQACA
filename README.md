Above is a list of the branches I created for this project. Spintbacklog_taskestimation contains a backlog of tasks and estimations of how long they will take to complete. Team_version_control contains a description of the branches used and how they fit in GitFlow. Test_coverage defines the test coverage tool I used and how I used it. Test_driven_development describes the commits made to my repository. Code_review contains a checklist of things that I should check when reviewing a Pull Request.

 The following branches: sprintbacklog_taskestimation, team_version_control, test_coverage, test_driven_development, code_review are merged into the develop branch. After review, the develop branch will finally be merged to the main branch as one README.md file.
