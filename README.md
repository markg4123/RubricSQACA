##  Task Estimation

##  Three-point Estimation

</p>

<br>
I used three-point estimate as I found that it is the most effective way to estimate tasks in scrum when doing so alone. With three-point estimate, I have three values, 1. The most likely value, 2. The optimistic value and 3. The pessimistic value.To calculate the actual estimate, I add the three values defined above and simply divide by 3. This gives me the most accurate task estimation value.
<br>

<br>
As seen in the Sprint Backlog above, Creating a new Rubric is given a estimation value of 1. Creating a new Rubric is relatively basic and will not require a lot of time to code. Alternatively, calculating the standard deviation is more of a complicated process and will take more time to code. Therefore it is given an estimation value of 4.
<br>

##  Velocity Metric

The Velocity Metric is calculated by adding up all the estimations for all fully completed tasks at the end of the Sprint. Knowing the velocity of a sprint allows me to know how many sprints it will take to achieve a desired level of functionality.

## Branches

- main
- develop
- sprint_backlog
- task_estimation
- team_version_control
- test_coverage
- test_driven_development
- code_review

<br>
Above is a list of the branches I created for this project. Spintbacklog_taskestimation contains a backlog of tasks and estimations of how long they will take to complete. Team_version_control contains a description of the branches used and how they fit in GitFlow. Test_coverage defines the test coverage tool I used and how I used it. Test_driven_development describes the commits made to my repository. Code_review contains a checklist of things that I should check when reviewing a Pull Request.
<br>

<br>
 The following branches: sprintbacklog_taskestimation, team_version_control, test_coverage, test_driven_development, code_review are merged into the develop branch. After review, the develop branch will finally be merged to the main branch as one README.md file.

# Code Review Checklist 

---
## What is a Code review?
---

Code review, also known as Peer Code Review, is a systematic examination of software code. The intention is to find bugs and improve software quality. Code review allows team members maintain a consistency between design and implementation techniques.

---
## Why do a Code review?
---

- Consistent design and implementation.
- Minimizing mistakes and their impact.
- Ensuring project quality and meeting requirements.

## Pull Requests
---

In this assignment, I am working individually and accept my own pull requests. After a pull request is created, I will approve it, if there is no more work to be done on it by commenting my approval on the request. The branches can then be merged.

## Code Review Checklist for Pull Requests
---

- Check for bad practices in the code.
- Analyse the impact of the changes being made.
- Ensure there is a high level of readability.
- Make sure there is consistent design and implementation.
- Ensure the quality is high and the code is meeting the requirements.
- Ensure there is correct spelling and grammar as markdown has no spellcheck. 


<br>
The above is the checklist I used for this assignment when approving pull requests. I found this worked well and minimised errors. Code review is an essential aspect of any software project and should always be carried out correctly.
